# Bangla_Speaker_Recognistion
The repository is an outcome of an academic project in the EEE 312 laboratory. A team of 5 members created a sizable Bangla voice dataset and tested speaker recognistion efficiency by using Machine learning approaches and CNN networks.
The voice features used are
1. Spectrogram
2. Mel-Spectrogram
3. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Co-efficient

We used Support-vector Machine based ML approach and CNN to train our model. A fairly good precision is achieved in predicting speakers.
